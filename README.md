# TenseReport

Upon attending the pitching session for Global Management of Chronic Disease at the Johns Hopkins MedHacks, the concern that spoke to us most was the struggles of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD's) in refugee populations. A large component of the problem was the lack of clinical resources immediately available to refugees. Regardless of the high demand of refugees seeking medical diagnosis, internal care physicians are not able to thoroughly diagnose of every individual refugee. We quickly connected the dots between technology available on smart phones and this healthcare workflow inefficiency, and were very enthusiastic about leveraging technology to bridge communicative set-backs in refugee camps.

Our Android application, TenseReport, leverages technology to reduce the time of hypertension diagnosis and treatment in Syrian refugees in Lebanon camps. This tool allows for primary care doctors to generate a diagnostic report consisting of preliminary blood pressure measurements, which is then sent to the internal medicine doctor to analyze and diagnose. This allows for primary care doctors to execute plans rather than waiting on constant communication with internal medicine doctors.

Using Xamarin forms, we developed an Android application that allows the primary care doctors to register patients and enter their blood pressure screening data. SQLite was used as our database to store this data, and Xamarin Essentials was used to formulate the diagnostic report and send it an inputted email.

Our team is very proud of developing an Android application walking us through the steps a primary care physician would walk through. While our demo solution was not at the complexity we desired, we are very proud of developing a functional database and email delivery.
